Managed types and utility classes for HID report parsing and transforming.

Work in progress, use with care üî•

## Motivation

How many utilities are floating out there either reading or transforming data from gaming input devices? HID Report reading/parsing is a common task for those and doing this by hand is tedious and prone to errors. Why not have a nice small class library you could consume and be done with it? Look no further, weary traveler, we've got you covered!    

## Goals

- **Compatibility**  
  Still on .NET Framework 4.8? No problem, we will not force you to upgrade for the core feature set, but you'll miss out on some awesome stuff .NET 6 and higher has to offer üòâ  
- **Performance**  
  We'll do our absolute best to avoid unnecessary copy actions or other expensive operations that could taint your report parsing experience üí™ Spans much?
- **Plausibility**  
  Juggling opaque byte arrays will sooner or later lead to errors, how about some validation helpers and plausibility checks before you send a report on its way? üëå

## Supported devices

- Sony‚Ñ¢ DualShock‚Ñ¢ 4 (PS4 Controller)
- Sony‚Ñ¢ DualSense‚Ñ¢ (PS5 Controller)

## NuGet

Until the library has reached level of maturity it won't be published on nuget.org, you can find [development builds on my private feed though](https://baget.nefarius.at/packages/nefarius.utilities.hidreportkit/) üëå Use at your own risk, no support provided whatsoever.
