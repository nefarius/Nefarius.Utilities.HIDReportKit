# Nefarius.Utilities.HIDReportKit

[![.NET](https://github.com/nefarius/Nefarius.Utilities.HIDReportKit/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nefarius/Nefarius.Utilities.HIDReportKit/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## About

TBD

## Motivation

How many utilities are floating out there either reading or transforming data from gaming input devices? HID Report reading/parsing is a common task for those and doing this by hand is tedious and prone to errors. Why not have a nice small class library you could consume and be done with it? Look no further, weary traveler, we've got you covered!    

## Goals

- **Compatibility**  
  Still on .NET Framework 4.8? No problem, we will not force you to upgrade for the core feature set, but you'll miss out on some awesome stuff .NET 6 and higher has to offer üòâ  
- **Performance**  
  We'll do our absolute best to avoid unnecessary copy actions or other expensive operations that could taint your report parsing experience üí™ Spans much?
- **Plausibility**  
  Juggling opaque byte arrays will sooner or later lead to errors, how about some validation helpers and plausibility checks before you send a report on its way? üëå

## Supported devices

- Sony DualShock 4 (PS4 Controller)
- Sony DualSense (PS5 Controller)
